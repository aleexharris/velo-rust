A blocking Rust client for the Velo Data API.

Create a suitable `Param`, `.connect()` your `Client` and then send the applicable requests.

Requests will either return results of either `ErrorKind` errors or Polars `DataFrame` types.

Want feedback as I started coding in Rust just a week ago and am about halfway through "the Book".
